 **/u/%s**! Congratulations!  
 You are the winner of this round of a $25 gift-card purchased with Dogecoin!  
 A PM has been sent to you with more details.  
 We would like to thank all members of the community here at /r/dogecoin. Without you, this wouldn't be possible because this is a crowd funded gift bot.  
 A special thank you to the folks at [eGifter](http://www.egifter.com) for supplying the large selection of cards. Check out their site
and maybe you might see a gift card you or someone you know might like.  :)  And of course they do accept doge coins for payment.
